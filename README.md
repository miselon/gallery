simple image uploading service

# [LIVE DEMO](https://miselon-gallery.herokuapp.com/)

### What is it?
This is a **Angular / Java + Spring Boot + Postgres** image uploading service featuring: 
- user registration with email confirmation, 
- Spring Security + JWT for user authentication and authorization

### What did I learn creating it?
I learned fundamentals of Spring Security and how to use JWTs for creating a full blown user management in a web application. Also this is my second app created using Angular, I learned different types of data binding and ways to exchange data between components. This was a great opportunity to dive deeper into the world of JavaScript and learn more about it's fundamentals. 

### Things that I would like to improve/add in the future:
- [ ] Implement photo descriptions
- [ ] Implement gallery layout editing in the client app
- [ ] Make the front-end responsive
